# spaceflight_mechanics
Computational assignments addressing spacecraft propagation problems commonly seen in orbital mechanics.


Includes computational procedures in the form of MATLAB scripts that incorporate knowledge of Newtonâ€™s laws of motion and gravitation,
relative motion, ordinary differential equation solvers, setting up n-body equations of motion, solution of the classical two-body problem,
restricted three-body approach, Lagrange points, and coordinate transformations.
